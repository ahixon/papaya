Current TODO
============

* fix swap out marking mmap pages
* implement share_vm syscall for actual bonus marks (whacky interface, but OK)
* need async open for exec tasks
	- will fix very ugly Yield hack in thread.c:548 (currently due to deadlock betweem mmap and main thread)

* use this async open for thread_create
* remove Yield hack in boot service and actually wait on magic endpoint for "sync" services to start
* bug fixes for stuff on Bitbucket tracker
