Current TODO
============

~~ swap ~~
* add created pages to frametable linked list + set flags as appropriate
* write target page algorithm
* mark buffers belonging to NFS, root server, VFS as 
* use internal cap to read/write to swap file

~~ other ~~
* implement share_vm syscall for actual bonus marks (whacky interface, but OK)
* need async open for exec tasks
	- will fix very ugly Yield hack in thread.c:548 (currently due to deadlock betweem mmap and main thread)

* use this async open for thread_create
* reduce active shares in svc_net and dev_console
	- create buffer pool, make most things use it
	- this may require a bit more thought if there's other sucky activity

* remove Yield hack in boot service and actually wait on magic endpoint for "sync" services to start

* general cleanup + documentation
* bug fixes for stuff on Bitbucket tracker
