# Lines starting with # are comments
# Fields should be separated by HARD TABS
# Format is similar to /etc/fstab:
#	<mountpoint>[TAB]<fstype>[TAB]options
#
# At the moment, options are not used by the VFS layer
# (they ARE passed to the filesystem but nobody uses them yet)
#
# In the future, VFS services may need to be slightly redesigned to
# support mounting block devices. Easiest way would be to launch a
# new service thread with provided options as arguments.

# FIXME: apparently order matters here
/	nfs	none
/dev	dev	none

# TODO: assumes no mnt/cpio folder in NFS mountpoint
# VFS should query all filesystems under that path and combine their
# results
#/mnt/cpio	cpio	readonly
