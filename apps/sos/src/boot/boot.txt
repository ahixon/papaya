# This file contains programs that are needed at boot time.
# It is parsed by the boot thread (see boot/boot.c).
#
# Format is: <cpio_file>=<type>
# where type is:
#   async   - start the service, but don't wait for it to start
#   sync    - start it, but wait for it to indicate that it has
#             finished starting. If it fails to start, boot will
#             not continue. WE DO NOT SUPPORT TIMEOUTS.
#   boot    - this is the boot program. We still start this and
#             terminate the boot process.
#
# Lines starting with a # are comments (obviously).
#
# Commands are executed in order, so if you have dependencies,
# you can load them the required order, using the necessary
# boot type.
#
# If a given program does not exist, the error will be reported
# on debug console (if available). Boot will continue.
